\section{Related work}

Related research such as \cite{deepfeaturesegment, SalamonDeepSegmentation} explore how the use of audio embeddings learned via unsupervised methods can enhance the performance of music segmentation algorithms leveraging the power of deep learning and data-driven feature learning to improve upon traditional, manually-engineered methods of music segmentation. 

Both studies conclude that using deep learning techniques to derive audio embeddings improves the performance of music segmentation algorithms, thus providing a better alternative to traditional manual feature engineering methods.
