\section{Related work}

Neural networks have recently facilitated the development of low-dimensional embeddings that capture essential musical features, enabling the computation of various task-specific aspects. 

These aspects include the utilization of multi-level music segmentation through deep audio embeddings to replace manually engineered features \cite{SalamonDeepSegmentation}, the enhancement of environmental sound classification \cite{Kim2020OneStrategies}, the improvement of vocal-centric music tasks using cross-domain audio embedding \cite{Kim2021LearningLoss}, the enhancement of audio classification through a combination of task-specific and pre-trained features \cite{Hung2022Feature-informedClassification}, the creation of a music similarity search engine specifically for video producers \cite{epidemic}, the improved performance in Music Emotion Recognition (MER) tasks \cite{KohComparisonRecognition}, embedding songs for similarity comparison based on artist identification \cite{contentmusicsimtriplet2020}, the resolution of the cross-modal text-to-music retrieval problem \cite{WonEmotionStories}, and music rearrangement \cite{Stoller2018IntuitiveTransitions}. This last innovative approach presents a promising avenue for automated music rearrangement, enhancing the process's efficiency and quality \cite{Plachouras2023MusicSegmentation}.

Moreover, deep audio embeddings offer the advantage of transferability. Once trained, these latent representations can be utilized as a starting point for various other tasks, thus saving computational resources and time compared to training a model from scratch \cite{HamelTransferSimilarity}.

On top of that and returning to musicological influences, the middle ground in Schenkerian analysis can be compared to the mesostructure in music. Analogous to the mesostructure, it represents the intermediate-level musical patterns that bridge the micro and macro structures. This element is often overlooked when applying deep learning to music. As emphasized by \cite{Mesostructures2023}, models that address this mesostructure level could significantly enrich tasks such as music analysis, composition, and retrieval, providing a more holistic understanding of music, similar to the insights gained from analyzing the middle-ground in Schenkerian analysis. \cite{Introduction_to_Schenkerian_Analysis}

Given their demonstrated success in the literature and their potential for transfer learning, exploring deep audio embeddings for MIR downstream tasks seems worthwhile.
