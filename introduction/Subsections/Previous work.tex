\section{Previous work}

Learning deep audio embeddings can somehow be considered as breaking down the essence of tonal music to its fundamental and most empirical elements. Dissecting musical structures from the most ethereal and spiritual foreground  to the foundational numerical nuances. 

It also delves into middle-ground elements and mesostructures \cite{Mesostructures2023}, bridging micro and macro structures with harmonic progressions, thematic materials, and voice-leading reductions.
