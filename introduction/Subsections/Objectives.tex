\section{Objectives}

As a professional music transcriber, I aim to understand how deep neural networks (DNNs) filter musical features, listen to the NN layers from a musician's perspective and analyze the resulting data. I aim to approach the technology from a technical and musical standpoint to understand how DNNs process and extract musical information. By doing so, I aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the process and contribute to developing AI technology for music analysis. By combining my expertise in music with my -not fully developed- knowledge of DNNs, I hope to bring a unique perspective to the field and contribute to the advancement of music analysis.

Music is a complex and multi-faceted phenomenon, and implementing a model that mimics human aural music skills is challenging. However, using the latest deep learning techniques, we aim to build a model that achieves good results for a specific task in the domain of music.
