\section{Objectives}

This study explores music's core tonal structure by constructing and analyzing an embedding space applicable to subsequent MIR tasks. 

By blending MIR computational techniques and a musicological approach, we intend to examine a broad spectrum of musical works across diverse styles and genres to mimic human aural skills in interpreting music to discern abstract and semantic musical elements, irrespective of the sonic qualities. 

The research focuses on learning a single embedding, $e(M)$, for a music piece $M$ which encapsulates the underlying high-level content such as melody contour, harmony inter-relationships, and other holistic elements. The structuring of the embedding space will prioritize the clustering of high-level musical content while maintaining agnostic to sonic quality features.
