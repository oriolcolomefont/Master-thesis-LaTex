# Master Thesis LaTeX Code

This repository contains the LaTeX code for my Master's Thesis in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The thesis aims to present and evaluate a new method for solving a specific problem in MIR. The code was built using Overleaf, an online LaTeX editor.

The code is organized into several files, including the main thesis.tex file, which compiles the entire document, and several chapter-specific files. The references.bib file contains the bibliographic information for the references cited in the thesis.

To compile the thesis, a LaTeX distribution, such as TeX Live or MiKTeX, is not required. The code can be easily edited and compiled using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own MIR thesis or to provide feedback on the methodology presented. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
