# Master Thesis LaTeX Code

This repository contains the LaTeX code for my Master's Thesis in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The thesis aims to present and evaluate Music Structure Analysis. The code was built using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online LaTeX editor.

The code is organized into several files, including the main MasterThesis.tex file, which compiles the entire document, and several chapter-specific files. The Mendeley references.bib files contain the bibliographic information for the references cited in the thesis.

Please feel free to use this code as a starting point for your MIR thesis or give me feedback on the methodology presented. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
