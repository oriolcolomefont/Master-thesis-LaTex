# Master Thesis LaTeX Code

This repository contains the LaTeX code for my Master's Thesis in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). The thesis aims to present and evaluate Music Structure Analysis. The code was built using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online LaTeX editor.

The code is organized into several files, including the main 'MasterThesis.tex' file, which compiles the entire document, and several chapter-specific files. The 'bibliography.bib' file contains the bibliographic information for the references cited in the thesis.

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own MIR thesis or to provide feedback on the methodology presented. If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
