Utilize the dB-scale Mel-spectrum magnitude of audio as input data; it is a popular choice for input representation in music-related tasks when applying CNNs, as has been demonstrated in various studies \cite{Kim2020OneStrategies}. In addition to their wide usage, it's been recently reported that their frequency-domain summarization, grounded in psycho-acoustics, is efficient and challenging to replicate through solely data-driven methods. \cite{Kim2020OneStrategies}
