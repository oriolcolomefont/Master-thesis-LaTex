\section{Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)}

A CNN, or Convolutional Neural Network, is a deep-learning neural network. The architecture of a CNN is composed of several layers, including:

\begin{itemize}

\item Convolutional layers: These layers apply a convolution operation to the input data, effectively learning local patterns and features in the image. The raw audio data is typically transformed into a spectrogram or a Mel-spectrogram representation, which can be considered an image-like 2D representation of the audio data. The convolutional layers are designed to learn local patterns and features in the audio data

\item Pooling layers: These layers downsample the data, reducing the spatial dimensions of the input while retaining important information. They can also be used to downsample the data and reduce the temporal dimensions of the input while retaining important information.

\item Fully connected layers: These layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in another layer, allowing the network to learn non-linear combinations of the features learned in the previous layers.

\item Output layer: The output layer produces the final predictions of the network.
\end{itemize}

Compared to a traditional neural network, CNNs are more computationally efficient and have less number of parameters to train. This makes them more feasible for large-scale datasets and real-world problems.

On top of that, one of the main advantages of using CNNs for audio analysis is that they can automatically and adaptively learn temporal hierarchies of features from audio data, which traditional audio processing methods may not be able to do effectively.
