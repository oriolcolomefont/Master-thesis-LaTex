Too little representation layer?

\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we introduced a method to uncover underlying high-level musical
content in the temporal domain by leveraging self-supervised deep neural networks to learn low-dimensional music latent representations with applications to music boundary detection. Building on existing approaches and architectures, we replaced traditional features with deep embeddings trained to represent high-level musical content information.
