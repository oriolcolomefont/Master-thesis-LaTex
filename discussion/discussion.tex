Too little representation layer?

\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we introduced a method to uncover underlying high-level musical
content in the temporal domain by leveraging self-supervised deep neural networks, inductive bias, and aural skills to learn music latent representations with applications to music boundary detection. Building on existing approaches and architectures, we replaced traditional features with deep embeddings trained to represent high-level musical content information.
