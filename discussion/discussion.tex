\section{Conclusions}

In this work, we introduced a method to uncover underlying high-level musical
content in the temporal domain by leveraging self-supervised deep neural networks, inductive bias, and aural skills to learn music latent representations with applications to MIR downstream tasks. Building on existing approaches and architectures, we replaced traditional features with deep embeddings trained to represent high-level musical content information.

The question as per \cite{Turian2022HEAR:Representations} remains if such general-purpose audio representation can mimic human hearing.
