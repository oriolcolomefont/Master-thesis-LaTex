\section{Music Structure Analysis as downstream task}

Let's pick a core MIR task as a sample to display such complexity: Music Structure Analysis (MSA), an interdisciplinary field that aims to understand the structure of music \cite{Nieto2020Audio-BasedApplications}. However, due to subjectivity, ambiguity, and data scarcity, audio-based MSA faces challenges like boundary placement ambiguity and similarity quantification \cite{NietoPerceptualMusic}. 

The main principles of MSA were initially defined as homogeneity, novelty, and repetition, with the addition of regularity. The checkerboard kernel technique is a simple and effective method for MSA based on the homogeneity principle. The kernel, with a checkerboard-like structure, is convolved over the main diagonal of a Self-Similarity Matrix (SSM) such as $S_{ij}$ is the similarity between time frames $i$ and $j$, $\vec{x}_i$ is the vector representation of time frame $i$, and $\left| \vec{x}_i \right|$ is the Euclidean norm of vector $\vec{x}_i$. The dot product of two vectors $\vec{x}_i$ and $\vec{x}_j$ is denoted by $\vec{x}_i \cdot \vec{x}_j$.

This yields a novelty curve highlighting sudden changes in the selected musical features from which to extract the segment boundaries.

Mathematical operations are used on predefined principles such as homogeneity and repetition to analyze a musical structure. It explores features extracted from a musical signal and identifies peaks in a novelty curve to extract segment boundaries. In contrast, human aural skills rely on the perception and interpretation of music by human listeners based on cultural and academic background. They can capture subtle nuances of musical structure, but those still are subjective and can vary across listeners.

Combining technical tasks, aural skills, and music perception is challenging due to the complexity and subjectivity of musical perception, discrepancies between the features extracted by DSP techniques and the features perceived by humans, and the variability of musical signals and individual differences in musical perception. 

Purely mathematical approaches may not always reflect how humans perceive music and may not capture the subtle variations in timing or harmonic relationships critical to musical perception. Variability in musical signals due to instrumentation, genre, and performance style further complicates the development of these techniques that can be generalized to different musical contexts.

\subsubsection{Bridging the gap}

Music similarity is a critical factor in query-by-example retrieval systems. However, similarity calculation and definition can differ depending on user needs and retrieval scenarios. While acoustic properties like voice, genre, melody, tempo, instrumentation, and rhythm contribute to similarity, personal preferences, and cultural context also play a significant role. For instance, a user may avoid a particular artist's music despite its similarity to their favorite artists due to the album cover. Moreover, the user's context, such as driving or running, can influence their preference and perception of similarity. 

Metadata is the traditional approach to electronic music searches, but it can be impractical and unintuitive for users unfamiliar with most tracks. Retrieval systems often overlook the cultural, personal, and musical aspects of music information needs, rendering them less useful for non-expert users. Many searches for music are based on emotions or usage context rather than bibliographic information.
