   abstract = {With recent advances in the field of music informatics, approaches to audio-based music structural analysis have matured considerably, allowing researchers to reassess the challenges posed by the task, and reimagine potential applications. We review the latest breakthroughs on this topic and discuss the challenges that may arise when applying these techniques in real-world applications. Specifically, we argue that it could be beneficial for these systems to be application-dependent in order to increase their usability. Moreover, in certain scenarios, a user may wish to decide which version of a structure to use, calling for systems with multiple outputs, or where the output adapts in a user-dependent fashion. In reviewing the state of the art and discussing the current challenges on this timely topic, we highlight the subjectivity, ambiguity, and hierarchical nature of musical structure as essential factors to address in future work.},

   abstract = {Audio signal processing is the most challenging field in the current era for an analysis of an audio signal. Audio signal classification (ASC) comprises of generating appropriate features from a sound and utilizing these features to distinguish the class the sound is most likely to fit. Based on the application’s classification domain, the characteristics extraction and classification/clustering algorithms used may be quite diverse. The paper provides the survey of the state-of art for understanding ASC’s general research scope, including different types of audio; representation of audio like acoustic, spectrogram; audio feature extraction techniques like physical, perceptual, static, dynamic; audio pattern matching approaches like pattern matching, acoustic phonetic, artificial intelligence; classification, and clustering techniques. The aim of this state-of-art paper is to produce a summary and guidelines for using the broadly used methods, to identify the challenges as well as future research directions of acoustic signal processing.},
